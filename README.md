# Knowledge Graph RAG System

This project is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates knowledge graph creation with document-based query answering. It uses Neo4j as the graph database, Groq's ChatGroq for language processing, and Hugging Face embeddings for document vectorization. The system allows for document upload, knowledge extraction, and querying with visual representation of relationships in a 3D graph format.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Upload a PDF document to extract entities and relationships.
- **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Automatically generates a knowledge graph based on extracted entities and relationships from the document.
- **Query Interface**: Ask questions based on the uploaded document, and retrieve both a generated answer and knowledge graph connections.
- **3D Graph Visualization**: Interactive 3D visualization of the knowledge graph using Plotly.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **Neo4j**: A graph database to store and query relationships.
- **Groq's ChatGroq**: For language processing and relationship extraction.
- **Hugging Face Embeddings**: For document vectorization and similarity-based retrieval.
- **Plotly**: To visualize relationships in a 3D graph.
- **LangChain**: To handle document loading, splitting, and RAG operations.

## Setup

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Neo4j instance running
- Groq API key for language processing
- Required Python libraries:
  - `neo4j`
  - `langchain`
  - `streamlit`
  - `plotly`
  - `networkx`
  - `pyvis`
  - `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knowledge-graph-rag-system.git
   cd knowledge-graph-rag-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Neo4j database and provide connection details in the `.env` file or directly in the script.

4. Get your **Groq API Key** by signing up on [Groq](https://www.groq.com/).

5. Update the configuration with the correct details:
   - **Neo4j URI**: Provide the URI of your running Neo4j instance.
   - **Neo4j Credentials**: Your Neo4j username and password.
   - **Groq API Key**: Your API key for ChatGroq.

### Running the Application

After setting up, run the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the web application. You can upload a PDF document, query the system, and view the generated knowledge graph.

## Usage

1. **Upload a PDF Document**: Drag and drop a PDF document into the upload box to extract entities and relationships.
2. **Query the Knowledge Base**: Enter a question related to the document, and the system will return an answer generated by the language model and display the related entities from the knowledge graph.
3. **Visualize Knowledge Graph**: View the 3D visualization of the knowledge graph, showing the relationships between entities.

## Customization

- You can modify the graph visualization settings in the sidebar to adjust the appearance of the 3D graph.
- You can extend the functionality to support other document formats or improve entity extraction by enhancing the prompt to the ChatGroq model.
